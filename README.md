# Micro Ruby on Rails application example

Uses only one file **config.ru**
to be run by [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack).

To run just type:
```
rackup
```

config.ru requires only action_controller/railtie to demonstrates route-controller-action example, but it can be extended easily to use other Rails features including ActiveRecord.
